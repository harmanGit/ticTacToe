# Part II. 
###Use mouse event (not buttons) to design a web page that allows the viewers to play the standard tic-tac-toe game with the machine.
Your web page displays a paragraph that explains the rule of the tic-tac-toe game and
a tic-tac-toe board. When the web page is opened the first time, a board is
displayed. When the player clicks a cell, your page gets the x- and y-
coordinates of position where the mouse-click occurred (research about how
clientX and clientY or screenX and screenY properties are used for finding
where a mouse-click occurrs) and places a cross symbol into the cell. If either
the machine or the player wins the game, a message following the board
needs to report the decision. Ideally, after a game is over, your page should
ask the player whether s/he wants to play another game or not.

1). This part of the assignment is also worth 20 points and the style of the
page is worth 5 points. Type your css code in a separate file. Work on your
css code carefully so that your page is colorful and neat.

2). Type your JavaScript code in a separate document.

3). Use a random generator to determine whether the machine or the human
starts to play the game first. For example, the machine starts to play first
when the number is 0 and the human starts to play when the number is 1.
