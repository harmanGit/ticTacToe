# ticTacToe
Project #1 for CS 461, Fall 2018. Tic-tac-toe website that uses buttons and or mouse clicks.

## Part I. 
Design a web page that allows the viewers to play the standard tic-tac-toe game with the machine.
 Your web page displays a paragraph that
  explains the rule of the tic-tac-toe game and a tic-tac-toe board. When the
  web page is opened the first time, each cell of the tic-tac-toe border contains
  a button with the cell indices such as (1, 2) on it. When the player clicks a
  button, the indices are replaced by a cross symbol. You may need an array
  to record the Xs and Os, and check whether the machine or the human
  player wins the game after each move. If either the machine or the player
  wins the game, a message following the board needs to report the decision.
  Ideally, after a game is over, your page should ask the player whether s/he
  wants to play another game or not.
  
  1). This part of the assignment is worth 20 points and the style of the page
  will be 5 points. Type your css code in a separate file. Work on your css code
  carefully so that your page has an aesthetical looking and neat.
  
  2). Type your JavaScript code in a separate document.
  
  3). Use a random generator to determine whether the machine or the human
  starts to play the game first. For example, the machine starts to play first
  when the number is 0 and the human starts to play when the number is 1.
  
 ## Part II. 
Use mouse event (not buttons) to design a web page that allows the viewers to play the standard tic-tac-toe game with the machine.
Your web page displays a paragraph that explains the rule of the tic-tac-toe game and
a tic-tac-toe board. When the web page is opened the first time, a board is
displayed. When the player clicks a cell, your page gets the x- and y-
coordinates of position where the mouse-click occurred (research about how
clientX and clientY or screenX and screenY properties are used for finding
where a mouse-click occurrs) and places a cross symbol into the cell. If either
the machine or the player wins the game, a message following the board
needs to report the decision. Ideally, after a game is over, your page should
ask the player whether s/he wants to play another game or not.

1). This part of the assignment is also worth 20 points and the style of the
page is worth 5 points. Type your css code in a separate file. Work on your
css code carefully so that your page is colorful and neat.

2). Type your JavaScript code in a separate document.

3). Use a random generator to determine whether the machine or the human
starts to play the game first. For example, the machine starts to play first
when the number is 0 and the human starts to play when the number is 1.
